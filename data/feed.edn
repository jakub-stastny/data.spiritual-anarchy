  ["This is probably the most epic story I ever heard. Dumuzzid details how Inanna, sumerian deity, came to his life and aligned his energy to pass through the Vishnu Granthi which he previously couldn't clear himself."
   "Dumuzzid is the main moderator of r/KundaliniAwakening, a humble and very knowledgeable person, who many people deeply respect. I can personally attest to the fact that he can indeed transmit powerful Shakti himself and that he does indeed work with Inanna, who came through him to me as well."]}]
