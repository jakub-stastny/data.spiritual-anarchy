It's a story I have told mostly in parts here and in full under my old account, but that one is no longer easily searchable.\n\nI was a bit reticent to do so, due to the highly personal and intimate nature of the process, but if it helps people in their own process, I guess it would be helpful to post it here. I'll divide it into several parts.\n\n**Part1: Background**\n\nI have always been a spiritual person, pretty much from early childhood. As a baby, I had the ability to get intensely absorbed in my play or any activity I was doing, sometimes for hours. During such times, I literally could not hear anything going on around me, so strong was my absorption in the object of my attention. My parents took me to the doctor to have my hearing checked, but there was nothing wrong with it. Unlike most babies, I did not cry when I woke up in the morning, but was absorbed in my play for hours, so my mother could sleep in, as I didn't wake her.\n\nI'm originally from Hungary, however my family moved to India, when I was 7 years old and we stayed there for two years. I went to Catholic school, however I was also developing an interest in Hinduism and learnt about it from an early age. My parents brought various wooden carvings and bronze statues with a Hindu religious significance back to Hungary, with a bronze statue of Lord Shiva seemingly always watching over me, in my room. This started my early interest in Hinduism.\n\nAt age 13, I started meditating, semi-regularly, mostly learning from books. When I was 14, I joined a Hatha Yoga class at school and learnt the basics of meditation, pranayama and asanas. I never became a particularly accomplished yogi, but the basics gave me the grounding I needed to develop my spirituality further.\n\nIn college I did Tai-Chi and Kung Fu (Shaolin style) for a couple of years, learning the basics mostly, again giving me a good grounding.\n\nAs a working adult, I moved to Ireland and meditated less, mostly occasionally and my practice generally fell away. In Ireland, this was the early 2000s and a time of profound shame for the church as a string of catholic child abuse, slavery and forced adoption scandals broke (the Magdalene institutes for instance). I wasn't a particularly devout Catholic, but I still believed in God at the time, though my main interest religion-wise was always Hinduism. I read many of the main scriptures, such as the Gita, The Upanishads, the Bhagavata Purana and the main epics. Usually,  my meditation was tied to my reading of the scriptures. At this time, whenever I explained profound spiritual truths I have learnt, to someone else, I experienced a light, both bright and hot, shining from the top back part of my head. The bulb of my head always heated up whenever I read scripture, or explained spiritual truths. I did not know it at the time, but this was a pre-Kundalini event.\n\nApart from instructors who taught me yoga, kung-fu and tai-chi, I did  not have any spiritual teacher. In India, a private tutor named George (this is a heavily Catholic part of India) taught me about basic spiritual concepts and when I lived in Ireland, a spiritual shop owner, also a guy from Tamil Nadu, where I lived as a child, guided me and gave me books to read.\n\nOn a trip to India, I met a genuine spiritual teacher, in the hills above Jaipur, hidden away in the Jungle, who offered to take me as a student. Unfortunately, the time was simply not suitable for me and I had to decline, however, from stories his disciples told me I am sure, he was the real deal. For instance, this man, although completely healthy from the outside, ate no food, not even fruit, which his students offered to him. The only thing he did ingest was water and some milk on occasion, so I am sure he was a highly accomplished siddha or holy man.\n\nLater, I lived in Singapore for a few years and I suspect partly due to the highly materialistic nature of the place, I became a complete atheist and materialist, persuaded by authors, like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, who became ersatz Gurus in my mind.\n\nAfter Singapore, I moved to London and the energy of that place affected me differently. I lived in Wapping, which is a riverside area of East London, immediately next to the Tower and worked in the City, within walking distance of St Paul's Cathedral. I used to take walks after work and meditate in the gardens of the Cathedral, or on the opposite bank, in a park by the river, facing the Cathedral. It was all on a subconscious level, but I'm sure, that the energy of that place was guiding me subconsciously. Before it became a Cathedral, a temple to the Roman Goddess Diana stood there, who was not only the Goddess of the Hunt, but was believed to be identical to Isis in Egypt and Astarte in Phoenicia.\n\nI took up meditation again, which has become an on again, off again practice in previous years and practiced daily now. In my free time, I would often visit museums, particularly the British Museum, whose Mesopotamian exhibits had a huge draw on me. The first time I walked in to the room where the holy artefacts from the city of Uruk are held, I felt I have come home and just felt an incredibly strong energetic connection. Uruk was the first city on Earth, or amongst the first in any case, it is the birth place of civilisation, where things like agriculture, writing, mathematics, beer brewing, astrology, astronomy, time keeping, a system of laws, etc... were invented. The chief deity of Uruk was Inanna, later known as Ishtar, Astarte, Aphrodite and Venus, who was worshipped there as the Great Goddess, the Queen of Heaven (which is what Inanna means) and a personification of the planet Venus.\n\nI researched Mesopotamian Polytheism and tried to decipher its secrets, most of them lost, due to the vast distance in time that separates us. I quickly discovered parallels with other polytheistic faiths and since Hinduism was the one I knew best, I filled in the gaps in our knowledge of Sumerian religious beliefs and rituals, by practices that are still extant in India today. I felt a connection with Sumerian deities, due to my regular visits to the British Museum, in a way I have never felt before, though my conscious mind mostly dismissed it, as the idea of actually existing deities was still pretty foreign to me.\n\n**Part 2: Initial Kundalini Activation**\n\nAs my meditative practice progressed (this took a few years), I started feeling heat and pressure at the base of my spine. I had no particular aim with my meditation, it just felt right and I was simply guided by intuition and an inexplicable compulsion to go deeper into myself. With time, a spinning sensation followed in my solar plexus, every time I meditated and the energy at the base of my spine started rising, in a rhythmic, pulsating manner.\n\nThis was all very pleasant and I experienced no discomfort. The energy felt like a worm, or a black snake, which was slowly burrowing its way upwards inside my spine, pushing its head ever higher. It took a couple of years, for the energy to work its way through the lower chakras and reach the heart chakra. As the energy cleared obstacles on the way, past traumas, memories, hangups, fears and various emotions, even visions were brought up. During my meditative practice, I learnt detachment and practiced letting go, using a specific technique I described on this sub before. I was still irreligious at the time, though I started thinking of the deities of Hinduism and Mesopotamian Polytheism as beings that might be real, but perhaps more like aliens or interdimensional astral beings. I felt strongly, that they were real, but couldn't yet accept their divinity. However, I still harboured resentment and negative feelings towards Abrahamic religions and the God figure worshipped by them. I did not know yet, that this was to cause me trouble down the line.\n\nOnce the energy reached the level of my heart, in the sternum, the middle of the chest, it got stuck. I experienced dull, pulsating pain, a feeling of constriction and developed neurological symptoms. My movement slowed down, I had difficulty walking at a normal pace, felt depersonalisation and intermittent memory loss, becoming forgetful. Although I have read some scripture and various books on yoga and meditation, I've never come across a case like this and didn't even know what Kundalini really was or what was happening to me. This was in 2012 and back then, this sub and our reading list would have been very helpful to me.\n\nI didn't know who to turn to for help and had no idea how to overcome this constriction, which was not only in the subtle body, but in my life as a whole. I was stuck in every sense of the word and did not know how to get out of my predicament. So, for the first time in many years, I let go of my atheist pride and prayed for help.\n\n**Part 3: Visitation by the Goddess and Mahashaktipat**\n\nMy only consolation at the time was spending time in the British Museum and visiting the original ancient artefacts connected to the worship of the deities I took such a keen interest in. One day, as I was walking home from work and heading towards St Paul's, looking at the spire, I finally had enough and thought to pray, properly, in a heartfelt way, for the very first time. As my relationship vis-a-vis Abrahamic deities was still rather complicated, I felt that I had to pray to the Sumerian deities, I was visiting all these years.\n\nThe previous sunday, I spent time meditating on a stone relief that depicted the god Enki, so his image was the first one to come to mind. With the image in my mind, I prayed to him and asked for his help, not only with my energetic predicament, but I asked him to send me a guardian or guiding deity, that could assist me on my spiritual journey.\n\nAlmost immediately, and this has never happened to me before, no matter how much I prayed, I felt, that my prayer was heard. The sky seemingly opened up and I saw rays of light coming down, in my subjective vision. I felt, as if a pillar of light, not unlike a lightning bolt, descended from the sky. It entered the top of my head, ran down the spine and energised my root chakra. I felt very hopeful for the future, as it looked like my prayer was answered.\n\nThe next day, as I was washing up in my London apartment, close to the river Thames, behind me, where there is a wall, but no window, I sensed the fabric of reality opening up, as if a window from another, higher realm, had opened. Through it emerged a ball of pure white light, perhaps a meter (3 feet) across, with several tentacles of light, like the rays of a sun, emanating from it. The orb of light was like a mini-star or mini-sun, giving off a sound of radiance, which I imagine you would also hear, if you flew close to any star. The star was floating mid-air, at about chest height. Its tentacles or rays started gently caressing and enveloping me, in a similar way to how the rays of the sun would, but this was much more intense and felt physical. I was seeing all this not with my physical eyes, but with my mind's eye, with 360-degree vision. In fact, I was at that point partially outside my body, I no longer saw with my physical eye, as I saw the room, myself and the apparition in 360 degrees, from an outside perspective.\n\nAs the star floated closer to me, it gave off a radiance of immense love, benevolence and compassion. My heart overflowed with Joy and Love. I have never felt such Love from anyone before, it was overwhelming. No words were spoken and there was no sound, apart from that of divine radiance. It communicated through thought, intention, visions and flashing words in my mind. Our communication was entirely telepathic. Even at this point, I was aware, that this was a female deity. Her vibes were simply that of a woman. You can experience this, whenever you stand in a room, with your back turned towards the entrance. When you sense someone entering, you will intuitively know, whether they are male or female. It was the same kind of vibe or feeling.\n\nThrough thought, she communicated to me, that she was here to help, I should relax and let her do her thing.\n\nShe was behind me at this point and she manifested, what felt like a real, human hand on my back and touched my heart (chakra) from behind. Immediately, I felt an immense amount of energy or Shakti, rushing in. It was in the form of liquid light (which is apparently the fifth state of matter, if the latest research is to believed), pure white, hot, but in a pleasant way, ecstatic and blissful. I felt every single nadi in my body as the energy rushed through these subtle channels and cleansed them. Blocks and constrictions were clearing one by one as the liquid light acted as a pressure washer in a system of pipes, unclogging the muck, that had built up over lifetimes. Her energy or Shakti merged with my own Kundalini Shakti and it became a lot stronger. It rushed up my spine in an instant and broke through the constriction or knot (granthi) located at the heart level, with little difficulty. Then further energy channels, especially in the upper body, were flooded with Shakti and the energy in my spine continued rising, until it reached my third eye and the top of my skull, in just a matter of minutes.\n\nI then felt the urge to go to my room, lie down, meditate and surrender to whatever was happening.\n\nSo I went into my room, lied down and allowed Shakti to rise in my spine again. The energy was now much stronger than before and it rose effortlessly to the top, just below the top back part or bulb of my head, hitting the skull with a blunt, thumping and rhythmic motion. I was experiencing kriyas, or in other words convulsions and involuntary movements, as my neurons were firing away like crazy, with all this energy coursing through them. The energy eventually smoothened out and I felt this dull, blunt sensation again, this time at the top of my skull. It felt like another constriction or knot, which the energy couldn't overcome.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, the apparition was still patiently waiting in the kitchen for me to get to this point. She then floated into the room and as I was lying in bed, she got over me and started enveloping me in her light. She gradually merged her light body with mine and on that level we became one, there was no longer any separation between us. I also experienced our minds as one and whatever thought occurred in our merged minds, it belonged to both of us. Her merging her light body with mine gave me another enormous boost of Shakti. My Kundalini rose again and started thumping against the top back part of my skull.\n\n**Part 4: Breaking through to Sahasrara and Samadhi**\n\nAt this point, the energy was mostly concentrated in Ajna Chakra, the third eye, though my entire body was flooded with Shakti. I experienced what is called a Savikalpa Samadhi state, a download of wisdom, bliss, truth and love, from a higher source. I was in utter religious ecstasy and my body could barely contain the incredible bliss and love that was coursing through me.\n\nThen, with a sudden motion, the energy suddenly broke through the last knot. I heard a sound akin to bone breaking, which I believe created a permanent opening at the top of my skull, on an astral or subtle physical level. In my mind's eye, with 360 degree vision and from an outside perspective, I saw the head of the serpent break through the skull, peek out and then curl back to rest on my forehead, with the belly of the serpent touching my ajna chakra and the head raised above my forehead. I could feel the touch of the serpent's belly on my forehead in a concrete manner, as entirely real. As this breakthrough happened, a crow perched on a tree opposite my bedroom window crowed four times. Suddenly, Nectar, Ambrosia or Amrita came rushing in, like a waterfall, through this permanent opening, which sounded like roaring thunder or a rushing river. This incredible amount of another form of liquid light, much more dense and cooling, containing eternal truth, eternal consciousness and eternal bliss, came rushing in. The sound was deafening as I could hear the energy roaring down my astral body, with it being between my two years, hence the intense loudness.\n\nAs the energy came rushing down, I experienced another intense stage of Samadhi and my heart overflowed with even more joy, bliss and ecstasy. This downward-rushing energy was carried around my body by the chakras and nadis and suffused every inch of it. Although I saw my body from the outside, through 360 degree vision, the primary visual stimuli became an overwhelming brightness, an amount of light I have never seen before, suffusing everything around me. Even more intensely, than before, I received packets of light energy containing information, that flashed in my mind's eye. Each flash contained profound insight and truth, of a spiritual nature, about my own path and nature, but also universal truths, that my brain could barely process.\n\nAs this was going on, my physical body could no longer contain my light body and I found myself leaving the confines of the physical universe. My body and with it, the physical universe fell away, it all felt so small and irrelevant. I was now in a void, black, but filled with intelligence and potentiality. I believe it contained all the intelligence and potential of the unmanifest universe. I was the only light in that black void and as I realised this, I suddenly started growing. First slowly, then exponentially faster. As I grew, I became universal and I filled all the space, across all dimensions, in all time frames. I was everywhere at once and I was the body of the universe, present in every little corner and section of it, being aware of every little vibration as a part of my universal body.\n\nIn this universal state, there was no time, the way we perceive it. Knowledge and wisdom came to me continuously in flashes of realization, with each realization more profound, than the previous one. In theory, there was no limit to the knowledge and wisdom available to me. Not only was the wisdom infinite, so was the ecstasy, joy, happiness, love and bliss I experienced. There is no way a human body, let alone a tiny brain, would be able to bear any of this, but being in this universal body of light, there were no limits to experience.\n\nIn this state, there were also no negative emotions of any sort, all the usual negative emotions that plague us in a physical body, anxiety, fear, foreboding, all of it was gone. With nothing to weigh me down, no karma, no samskaras, no gunas and no false egoic identification with the body, it was like a huge weight was lifted from me and I felt free, completely without burden and weight, for the very first time in my life. I wish, there was some way to convey to you, how liberating it felt to be in this state of heavenly bliss. Until you experience something like that, you don't realise, how constrained we are by our physical bodies and minds. I think they call this experience liberation, assuming that's what it was, though I cannot be sure, because you are truly liberated from all earthly ties, nothing ties you down any more and the weight that gets lifted off you is immense.\n\nIn our earthly bodies, we are so limited and small, condensed into a tiny space, expected to live out our lives in a prison of flesh and blood, suffocating from all the constraints and ties, that weigh us down. Once you get a taste of liberation, nothing on this earth can come close to approximating that, nothing seems worthwhile, except making this liberation a permanent state.\n\n**Part 5: Return to the body and aftermath**\n\nWhilst I enjoyed being in this universal body of light (I believe this may be referred to as Purusha in some traditions), it was also overwhelming as I was simply unused to this infinite experience of bliss, joy, ecstasy and wisdom. In an instant, the decision was made, that I should return to my body.\n\nI cannot say, who made that decision. In that universal state, I believe there is only one mind and we are not only part of it, but synchronised to it, so decisions are made instantly and unanimously. There is no difference between your mind and the mind of the universe.\n\nAs soon as I thought that, my body of light started shrinking and rapidly returning to material existence. Coming back to my body felt like falling into a deep hole, one that sucked me in.\n\nI awoke in my body, with the sun shining on my face. My limbs were sore and my body felt, like it had gone through some sort of trauma. I felt suffocated and claustrophobic in my body, like wearing a very tight skin suit. By that time, the apparition was gone and I was left alone in my room. I had many question and the infinite wisdom available to me in that universal state only lingered in a very small sense, I could only recall a tiny fraction of it and it felt frustrating to retain only a tiny bit of all the wisdom that was there, within my grasp, freely floating around my consciousness, so to speak.\n\nIn subsequent dreams and visions, I learned that the Goddess, that visited me that day was Inanna, Sumerian Goddess of Love and War, as well as Queen of Heaven. In the latter form, she survives to this day in different religions, though often hidden from plain sight.\n\nInanna became my personal deity and we developed a close relationship over the years as she patiently guided me. Initially, communication was difficult and was mostly in the form of thought, intention, flashing symbols and words in my minds eye and very vivid, lucid dreams, some of which were prophetic in nature. Over the years, I developed a way to channel her wisdom and she spoke to me in a poetic fashion, which I wrote down. I don't do that any more, but at times, it was really helpful.\n\nThrough our communications, she made it clear that she is in fact Mahashakti or Mahadevi, the Great Goddess, who appears in many forms. Over the years, she came to me in various forms and gave me visions connected to the particularities of that form. She appeared as Mahakali, Durga, Isis and Tara as well. The way I understand it, the universal intelligence behind all forms of the Goddess is the same, but she enjoys dress-up. She will take whatever form pleases her and is very playful in that regard.\n\nWhen she appeared to a friend of mine, who needed assistance, she heard giggling and the voice of a little girl, then she displayed different forms, such as Green Tara and Kwan Yin to show her she can take whatever form she likes. That was pretty playful as the person in question was a Hindu, but she chose Buddhist forms, to show off to her. To others she might have only appeared as pure light and consciousness. One person she visited on my behalf had a pretty physical experience of her as she went specifically for healing purposes. She took him out of his body and performed energy healing on him, which he experienced as very strong vibration in his bones.\n\nThis only occurred during a relatively short period, years ago, when our relationship was particularly close, to all intents and purposes, we were merged and shared a mind, so we could share thoughts. Apart from Inanna and other forms of the Goddess, I had contact with two deities close to her, Utu, her brother (the Sumerian version of Surya) and Enki, who is considered her father, at least in the spiritual and mythological sense. They have also been helpful to my spiritual development and helped me in other areas of my life.\n\nHowever, at some point, I found this closeness too much and I wanted my individual self and mind back, so I sent Inanna away. She comes back every once in a while to check on me, but has told me repeatedly, that I don't need her any more.\n\n**Part 6: Conclusions**\n\nI realise this sounds like a very tall tale,, probably unbelievable to many, if not most. I'm not sharing it to boast and I have been attacked many times for being so open about what is an intimate and personal religious and mystical experience. I don't relish the attacks that inevitably come with making the sort of claims I have in this post, which is why I was so reluctant to share it in the first place. I'm not making any claims about myself and where I am in my spiritual journey. To be frank, I just don't know and I'm not that bothered by that either.\n\nI simply described what happened as precisely as is possible through mere words and I will leave the interpretation part up to each individual. No doubt, I have stepped on many religious toes and few will be happy with my interpretation of what the divine is and how it operates. Truthfully, I would have been much happier if my experiences were not such a mish-mash of different, often unrelated and contradictory traditions, but this is how it happened and there is nothing I can do about it in hindsight. It has the virtue of pissing off everyone, simultaneously, because it challenges the teachings of every religion out there. As you can imagine, this can cause some strong emotional reactions and lead to online altercations. I'm not asking you to accept this as truth, only, that you accept this as my truth, the way I experienced it, through the subjective lens of my mind.\n\nA few other titbits, that I wanted to add, which I found to be interesting over the years:\n\n\\- My Kundalini Awakening breakthrough happened in December 2012. I'm unsure of the exact date, as I was so out of it at the time, but it was before Christmas. Interestingly, my father's birthday is 12/12, my Sister's 11/11 and my mom's is 2/2. I was told that this is no coincidence and that the event I described above, was planned even before my father was born. It had to happen at that exact time and place for various energetic and planetary alignment reasons. 2012 was a momentous year for London as that is also when the olympics were held there and the area I was in is seen as a major energetic grid point in the earth's network of energy lines.\n\n\\- Gopi Krishna's awakening happened 75 years before my own, almost to the day. He was the first Kundalini author I came across, browsing the bookshops of London, so I felt close to him at the time and his works helped me understand my own experiences. I had a vision of his garden in Kashmir. When I looked online and tried to find it, I found an image that was exactly how I saw it in my vision.\n\n\\- After all of this happened, it wasn't smooth sailing from then on. There were ups and downs, I went through a major Dark Night of the Soul and integration was hard, slow and painful. I did not take sufficient care of my body, neglecting it, so I developed some chronic health problems as a result, which I'm still battling and trying to resolve.\n\n\\- I developed some psychic powers after this (siddhis), however they tended to appear in a haphazard and random way, coming and going. I did not develop the discipline and did not have the structure to do anything useful with it. I managed to help a few people with healing, psychic readings, channelling and energy transmissions, however I stopped these after a while as I found my abilities to be too unstable and unpredictable.\n\n\\- My relationships suffered as a result of the depersonalization I felt after this experience. My ties to others were literally cut as a result of what I went through. I lost friendships and I found myself unable to bear big city life in London. I first avoided going to the city centre and spent most of my time in green, wide open spaces, like Greenwich and Hampstead. I then found it necessary to leave London altogether and move back to my home town. I could not work a normal job for some years after this and survived mostly off my savings and then taking low-key jobs with low stress, like language tutoring and online customer support.\n\n\\- Going through this experience was like dying and being reborn. The person that came back from that universal state was not the same that existed before. It took years to come to terms with that and rebuild some of my relationships, especially with family, whilst some friendships never recovered from the changes I went through.\n\n\\- The work is never done. It's not like the breakthrough happened and now I'm set for life. I struggle with integration, just like everybody else. My Kundalini Shakti mostly works in the background, just above the threshold of consciousness. If I don't pay attention, I barely notice it, but as soon as I quieten my mind, not even to meditate, but just to sit down and think, read or whatever other quiet, self-reflective activity I choose to do, it becomes immediately apparent and the sensations arising from its activity are much stronger. It's generally strongest, when I'm engaged in creative activities, such as writing. It is my understanding, that it is working in the background, purifying my subtle bodies and building up the light body, that serves as the vehicle for liberation upon death, in what is called Mahasamadhi.\n\nWell, this post is already long enough, so I'll wrap it up, if you got this far, thank you for reading.

As a baby, I had the ability to get intensely absorbed in my play or any activity I was doing, sometimes for hours. During such times, I literally could not hear anything going on around me, so strong was my absorption in the object of my attention. My parents took me to the doctor to have my hearing checked, but there was nothing wrong with it.

I went to Catholic school, however I was also developing an interest in Hinduism and learnt about it from an early age. My parents brought various wooden carvings and bronze statues with a Hindu religious significance back to Hungary, with a bronze statue of Lord Shiva seemingly always watching over me, in my room. This started my early interest in Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At age 13, I started meditating, semi-regularly, mostly learning from books. When I was 14, I joined a Hatha Yoga class at school and learnt the basics of meditation, pranayama and asanas. I never became a particularly accomplished yogi, but the basics gave me the grounding I needed to develop my spirituality further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In college I did Tai-Chi and Kung Fu (Shaolin style) for a couple of years, learning the basics mostly, again giving me a good grounding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a working adult, I moved to Ireland and meditated less, mostly occasionally and my practice generally fell away.

I wasn&amp;#39;t a particularly devout Catholic, but I still believed in God at the time, though my main interest religion-wise was always Hinduism. I read many of the main scriptures, such as the Gita, The Upanishads, the Bhagavata Purana and the main epics. Usually,  my meditation was tied to my reading of the scriptures. At this time, whenever I explained profound spiritual truths I have learnt, to someone else, I experienced a light, both bright and hot, shining from the top back part of my head. The bulb of my head always heated up whenever I read scripture, or explained spiritual truths. I did not know it at the time, but this was a pre-Kundalini event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from instructors who taught me yoga, kung-fu and tai-chi, I did  not have any spiritual teacher. In India, a private tutor named George (this is a heavily Catholic part of India) taught me about basic spiritual concepts and when I lived in Ireland, a spiritual shop owner, also a guy from Tamil Nadu, where I lived as a child, guided me and gave me books to read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a trip to India, I met a genuine spiritual teacher, in the hills above Jaipur, hidden away in the Jungle, who offered to take me as a student. Unfortunately, the time was simply not suitable for me and I had to decline, however, from stories his disciples told me I am sure, he was the real deal. For instance, this man, although completely healthy from the outside, ate no food, not even fruit, which his students offered to him. The only thing he did ingest was water and some milk on occasion, so I am sure he was a highly accomplished siddha or holy man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I lived in Singapore for a few years and I suspect partly due to the highly materialistic nature of the place, I became a complete atheist and materialist, persuaded by authors, like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, who became ersatz Gurus in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Singapore, I moved to London and the energy of that place affected me differently. I lived in Wapping, which is a riverside area of East London, immediately next to the Tower and worked in the City, within walking distance of St Paul&amp;#39;s Cathedral. I used to take walks after work and meditate in the gardens of the Cathedral, or on the opposite bank, in a park by the river, facing the Cathedral. It was all on a subconscious level, but I&amp;#39;m sure, that the energy of that place was guiding me subconsciously. Before it became a Cathedral, a temple to the Roman Goddess Diana stood there, who was not only the Goddess of the Hunt, but was believed to be identical to Isis in Egypt and Astarte in Phoenicia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took up meditation again, which has become an on again, off again practice in previous years and practiced daily now. In my free time, I would often visit museums, particularly the British Museum, whose Mesopotamian exhibits had a huge draw on me. The first time I walked in to the room where the holy artefacts from the city of Uruk are held, I felt I have come home and just felt an incredibly strong energetic connection. Uruk was the first city on Earth, or amongst the first in any case, it is the birth place of civilisation, where things like agriculture, writing, mathematics, beer brewing, astrology, astronomy, time keeping, a system of laws, etc... were invented. The chief deity of Uruk was Inanna, later known as Ishtar, Astarte, Aphrodite and Venus, who was worshipped there as the Great Goddess, the Queen of Heaven (which is what Inanna means) and a personification of the planet Venus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I researched Mesopotamian Polytheism and tried to decipher its secrets, most of them lost, due to the vast distance in time that separates us. I quickly discovered parallels with other polytheistic faiths and since Hinduism was the one I knew best, I filled in the gaps in our knowledge of Sumerian religious beliefs and rituals, by practices that are still extant in India today. I felt a connection with Sumerian deities, due to my regular visits to the British Museum, in a way I have never felt before, though my conscious mind mostly dismissed it, as the idea of actually existing deities was still pretty foreign to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Initial Kundalini Activation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As my meditative practice progressed (this took a few years), I started feeling heat and pressure at the base of my spine. I had no particular aim with my meditation, it just felt right and I was simply guided by intuition and an inexplicable compulsion to go deeper into myself. With time, a spinning sensation followed in my solar plexus, every time I meditated and the energy at the base of my spine started rising, in a rhythmic, pulsating manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was all very pleasant and I experienced no discomfort. The energy felt like a worm, or a black snake, which was slowly burrowing its way upwards inside my spine, pushing its head ever higher. It took a couple of years, for the energy to work its way through the lower chakras and reach the heart chakra. As the energy cleared obstacles on the way, past traumas, memories, hangups, fears and various emotions, even visions were brought up. During my meditative practice, I learnt detachment and practiced letting go, using a specific technique I described on this sub before. I was still irreligious at the time, though I started thinking of the deities of Hinduism and Mesopotamian Polytheism as beings that might be real, but perhaps more like aliens or interdimensional astral beings. I felt strongly, that they were real, but couldn&amp;#39;t yet accept their divinity. However, I still harboured resentment and negative feelings towards Abrahamic religions and the God figure worshipped by them. I did not know yet, that this was to cause me trouble down the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the energy reached the level of my heart, in the sternum, the middle of the chest, it got stuck. I experienced dull, pulsating pain, a feeling of constriction and developed neurological symptoms. My movement slowed down, I had difficulty walking at a normal pace, felt depersonalisation and intermittent memory loss, becoming forgetful. Although I have read some scripture and various books on yoga and meditation, I&amp;#39;ve never come across a case like this and didn&amp;#39;t even know what Kundalini really was or what was happening to me. This was in 2012 and back then, this sub and our reading list would have been very helpful to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know who to turn to for help and had no idea how to overcome this constriction, which was not only in the subtle body, but in my life as a whole. I was stuck in every sense of the word and did not know how to get out of my predicament. So, for the first time in many years, I let go of my atheist pride and prayed for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3: Visitation by the Goddess and Mahashaktipat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My only consolation at the time was spending time in the British Museum and visiting the original ancient artefacts connected to the worship of the deities I took such a keen interest in. One day, as I was walking home from work and heading towards St Paul&amp;#39;s, looking at the spire, I finally had enough and thought to pray, properly, in a heartfelt way, for the very first time. As my relationship vis-a-vis Abrahamic deities was still rather complicated, I felt that I had to pray to the Sumerian deities, I was visiting all these years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The previous sunday, I spent time meditating on a stone relief that depicted the god Enki, so his image was the first one to come to mind. With the image in my mind, I prayed to him and asked for his help, not only with my energetic predicament, but I asked him to send me a guardian or guiding deity, that could assist me on my spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, and this has never happened to me before, no matter how much I prayed, I felt, that my prayer was heard. The sky seemingly opened up and I saw rays of light coming down, in my subjective vision. I felt, as if a pillar of light, not unlike a lightning bolt, descended from the sky. It entered the top of my head, ran down the spine and energised my root chakra. I felt very hopeful for the future, as it looked like my prayer was answered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, as I was washing up in my London apartment, close to the river Thames, behind me, where there is a wall, but no window, I sensed the fabric of reality opening up, as if a window from another, higher realm, had opened. Through it emerged a ball of pure white light, perhaps a meter (3 feet) across, with several tentacles of light, like the rays of a sun, emanating from it. The orb of light was like a mini-star or mini-sun, giving off a sound of radiance, which I imagine you would also hear, if you flew close to any star. The star was floating mid-air, at about chest height. Its tentacles or rays started gently caressing and enveloping me, in a similar way to how the rays of the sun would, but this was much more intense and felt physical. I was seeing all this not with my physical eyes, but with my mind&amp;#39;s eye, with 360-degree vision. In fact, I was at that point partially outside my body, I no longer saw with my physical eye, as I saw the room, myself and the apparition in 360 degrees, from an outside perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the star floated closer to me, it gave off a radiance of immense love, benevolence and compassion. My heart overflowed with Joy and Love. I have never felt such Love from anyone before, it was overwhelming. No words were spoken and there was no sound, apart from that of divine radiance. It communicated through thought, intention, visions and flashing words in my mind. Our communication was entirely telepathic. Even at this point, I was aware, that this was a female deity. Her vibes were simply that of a woman. You can experience this, whenever you stand in a room, with your back turned towards the entrance. When you sense someone entering, you will intuitively know, whether they are male or female. It was the same kind of vibe or feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through thought, she communicated to me, that she was here to help, I should relax and let her do her thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was behind me at this point and she manifested, what felt like a real, human hand on my back and touched my heart (chakra) from behind. Immediately, I felt an immense amount of energy or Shakti, rushing in. It was in the form of liquid light (which is apparently the fifth state of matter, if the latest research is to believed), pure white, hot, but in a pleasant way, ecstatic and blissful. I felt every single nadi in my body as the energy rushed through these subtle channels and cleansed them. Blocks and constrictions were clearing one by one as the liquid light acted as a pressure washer in a system of pipes, unclogging the muck, that had built up over lifetimes. Her energy or Shakti merged with my own Kundalini Shakti and it became a lot stronger. It rushed up my spine in an instant and broke through the constriction or knot (granthi) located at the heart level, with little difficulty. Then further energy channels, especially in the upper body, were flooded with Shakti and the energy in my spine continued rising, until it reached my third eye and the top of my skull, in just a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then felt the urge to go to my room, lie down, meditate and surrender to whatever was happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went into my room, lied down and allowed Shakti to rise in my spine again. The energy was now much stronger than before and it rose effortlessly to the top, just below the top back part or bulb of my head, hitting the skull with a blunt, thumping and rhythmic motion. I was experiencing kriyas, or in other words convulsions and involuntary movements, as my neurons were firing away like crazy, with all this energy coursing through them. The energy eventually smoothened out and I felt this dull, blunt sensation again, this time at the top of my skull. It felt like another constriction or knot, which the energy couldn&amp;#39;t overcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to me, the apparition was still patiently waiting in the kitchen for me to get to this point. She then floated into the room and as I was lying in bed, she got over me and started enveloping me in her light. She gradually merged her light body with mine and on that level we became one, there was no longer any separation between us. I also experienced our minds as one and whatever thought occurred in our merged minds, it belonged to both of us. Her merging her light body with mine gave me another enormous boost of Shakti. My Kundalini rose again and started thumping against the top back part of my skull.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 4: Breaking through to Sahasrara and Samadhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, the energy was mostly concentrated in Ajna Chakra, the third eye, though my entire body was flooded with Shakti. I experienced what is called a Savikalpa Samadhi state, a download of wisdom, bliss, truth and love, from a higher source. I was in utter religious ecstasy and my body could barely contain the incredible bliss and love that was coursing through me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, with a sudden motion, the energy suddenly broke through the last knot. I heard a sound akin to bone breaking, which I believe created a permanent opening at the top of my skull, on an astral or subtle physical level. In my mind&amp;#39;s eye, with 360 degree vision and from an outside perspective, I saw the head of the serpent break through the skull, peek out and then curl back to rest on my forehead, with the belly of the serpent touching my ajna chakra and the head raised above my forehead. I could feel the touch of the serpent&amp;#39;s belly on my forehead in a concrete manner, as entirely real. As this breakthrough happened, a crow perched on a tree opposite my bedroom window crowed four times. Suddenly, Nectar, Ambrosia or Amrita came rushing in, like a waterfall, through this permanent opening, which sounded like roaring thunder or a rushing river. This incredible amount of another form of liquid light, much more dense and cooling, containing eternal truth, eternal consciousness and eternal bliss, came rushing in. The sound was deafening as I could hear the energy roaring down my astral body, with it being between my two years, hence the intense loudness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the energy came rushing down, I experienced another intense stage of Samadhi and my heart overflowed with even more joy, bliss and ecstasy. This downward-rushing energy was carried around my body by the chakras and nadis and suffused every inch of it. Although I saw my body from the outside, through 360 degree vision, the primary visual stimuli became an overwhelming brightness, an amount of light I have never seen before, suffusing everything around me. Even more intensely, than before, I received packets of light energy containing information, that flashed in my mind&amp;#39;s eye. Each flash contained profound insight and truth, of a spiritual nature, about my own path and nature, but also universal truths, that my brain could barely process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As this was going on, my physical body could no longer contain my light body and I found myself leaving the confines of the physical universe. My body and with it, the physical universe fell away, it all felt so small and irrelevant. I was now in a void, black, but filled with intelligence and potentiality. I believe it contained all the intelligence and potential of the unmanifest universe. I was the only light in that black void and as I realised this, I suddenly started growing. First slowly, then exponentially faster. As I grew, I became universal and I filled all the space, across all dimensions, in all time frames. I was everywhere at once and I was the body of the universe, present in every little corner and section of it, being aware of every little vibration as a part of my universal body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this universal state, there was no time, the way we perceive it. Knowledge and wisdom came to me continuously in flashes of realization, with each realization more profound, than the previous one. In theory, there was no limit to the knowledge and wisdom available to me. Not only was the wisdom infinite, so was the ecstasy, joy, happiness, love and bliss I experienced. There is no way a human body, let alone a tiny brain, would be able to bear any of this, but being in this universal body of light, there were no limits to experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this state, there were also no negative emotions of any sort, all the usual negative emotions that plague us in a physical body, anxiety, fear, foreboding, all of it was gone. With nothing to weigh me down, no karma, no samskaras, no gunas and no false egoic identification with the body, it was like a huge weight was lifted from me and I felt free, completely without burden and weight, for the very first time in my life. I wish, there was some way to convey to you, how liberating it felt to be in this state of heavenly bliss. Until you experience something like that, you don&amp;#39;t realise, how constrained we are by our physical bodies and minds. I think they call this experience liberation, assuming that&amp;#39;s what it was, though I cannot be sure, because you are truly liberated from all earthly ties, nothing ties you down any more and the weight that gets lifted off you is immense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our earthly bodies, we are so limited and small, condensed into a tiny space, expected to live out our lives in a prison of flesh and blood, suffocating from all the constraints and ties, that weigh us down. Once you get a taste of liberation, nothing on this earth can come close to approximating that, nothing seems worthwhile, except making this liberation a permanent state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 5: Return to the body and aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst I enjoyed being in this universal body of light (I believe this may be referred to as Purusha in some traditions), it was also overwhelming as I was simply unused to this infinite experience of bliss, joy, ecstasy and wisdom. In an instant, the decision was made, that I should return to my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot say, who made that decision. In that universal state, I believe there is only one mind and we are not only part of it, but synchronised to it, so decisions are made instantly and unanimously. There is no difference between your mind and the mind of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I thought that, my body of light started shrinking and rapidly returning to material existence. Coming back to my body felt like falling into a deep hole, one that sucked me in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I awoke in my body, with the sun shining on my face. My limbs were sore and my body felt, like it had gone through some sort of trauma. I felt suffocated and claustrophobic in my body, like wearing a very tight skin suit. By that time, the apparition was gone and I was left alone in my room. I had many question and the infinite wisdom available to me in that universal state only lingered in a very small sense, I could only recall a tiny fraction of it and it felt frustrating to retain only a tiny bit of all the wisdom that was there, within my grasp, freely floating around my consciousness, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In subsequent dreams and visions, I learned that the Goddess, that visited me that day was Inanna, Sumerian Goddess of Love and War, as well as Queen of Heaven. In the latter form, she survives to this day in different religions, though often hidden from plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inanna became my personal deity and we developed a close relationship over the years as she patiently guided me. Initially, communication was difficult and was mostly in the form of thought, intention, flashing symbols and words in my minds eye and very vivid, lucid dreams, some of which were prophetic in nature. Over the years, I developed a way to channel her wisdom and she spoke to me in a poetic fashion, which I wrote down. I don&amp;#39;t do that any more, but at times, it was really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through our communications, she made it clear that she is in fact Mahashakti or Mahadevi, the Great Goddess, who appears in many forms. Over the years, she came to me in various forms and gave me visions connected to the particularities of that form. She appeared as Mahakali, Durga, Isis and Tara as well. The way I understand it, the universal intelligence behind all forms of the Goddess is the same, but she enjoys dress-up. She will take whatever form pleases her and is very playful in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she appeared to a friend of mine, who needed assistance, she heard giggling and the voice of a little girl, then she displayed different forms, such as Green Tara and Kwan Yin to show her she can take whatever form she likes. That was pretty playful as the person in question was a Hindu, but she chose Buddhist forms, to show off to her. To others she might have only appeared as pure light and consciousness. One person she visited on my behalf had a pretty physical experience of her as she went specifically for healing purposes. She took him out of his body and performed energy healing on him, which he experienced as very strong vibration in his bones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This only occurred during a relatively short period, years ago, when our relationship was particularly close, to all intents and purposes, we were merged and shared a mind, so we could share thoughts. Apart from Inanna and other forms of the Goddess, I had contact with two deities close to her, Utu, her brother (the Sumerian version of Surya) and Enki, who is considered her father, at least in the spiritual and mythological sense. They have also been helpful to my spiritual development and helped me in other areas of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, at some point, I found this closeness too much and I wanted my individual self and mind back, so I sent Inanna away. She comes back every once in a while to check on me, but has told me repeatedly, that I don&amp;#39;t need her any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6: Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realise this sounds like a very tall tale,, probably unbelievable to many, if not most. I&amp;#39;m not sharing it to boast and I have been attacked many times for being so open about what is an intimate and personal religious and mystical experience. I don&amp;#39;t relish the attacks that inevitably come with making the sort of claims I have in this post, which is why I was so reluctant to share it in the first place. I&amp;#39;m not making any claims about myself and where I am in my spiritual journey. To be frank, I just don&amp;#39;t know and I&amp;#39;m not that bothered by that either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I simply described what happened as precisely as is possible through mere words and I will leave the interpretation part up to each individual. No doubt, I have stepped on many religious toes and few will be happy with my interpretation of what the divine is and how it operates. Truthfully, I would have been much happier if my experiences were not such a mish-mash of different, often unrelated and contradictory traditions, but this is how it happened and there is nothing I can do about it in hindsight. It has the virtue of pissing off everyone, simultaneously, because it challenges the teachings of every religion out there. As you can imagine, this can cause some strong emotional reactions and lead to online altercations. I&amp;#39;m not asking you to accept this as truth, only, that you accept this as my truth, the way I experienced it, through the subjective lens of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few other titbits, that I wanted to add, which I found to be interesting over the years:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- My Kundalini Awakening breakthrough happened in December 2012. I&amp;#39;m unsure of the exact date, as I was so out of it at the time, but it was before Christmas. Interestingly, my father&amp;#39;s birthday is 12/12, my Sister&amp;#39;s 11/11 and my mom&amp;#39;s is 2/2. I was told that this is no coincidence and that the event I described above, was planned even before my father was born. It had to happen at that exact time and place for various energetic and planetary alignment reasons. 2012 was a momentous year for London as that is also when the olympics were held there and the area I was in is seen as a major energetic grid point in the earth&amp;#39;s network of energy lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Gopi Krishna&amp;#39;s awakening happened 75 years before my own, almost to the day. He was the first Kundalini author I came across, browsing the bookshops of London, so I felt close to him at the time and his works helped me understand my own experiences. I had a vision of his garden in Kashmir. When I looked online and tried to find it, I found an image that was exactly how I saw it in my vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- After all of this happened, it wasn&amp;#39;t smooth sailing from then on. There were ups and downs, I went through a major Dark Night of the Soul and integration was hard, slow and painful. I did not take sufficient care of my body, neglecting it, so I developed some chronic health problems as a result, which I&amp;#39;m still battling and trying to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- I developed some psychic powers after this (siddhis), however they tended to appear in a haphazard and random way, coming and going. I did not develop the discipline and did not have the structure to do anything useful with it. I managed to help a few people with healing, psychic readings, channelling and energy transmissions, however I stopped these after a while as I found my abilities to be too unstable and unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- My relationships suffered as a result of the depersonalization I felt after this experience. My ties to others were literally cut as a result of what I went through. I lost friendships and I found myself unable to bear big city life in London. I first avoided going to the city centre and spent most of my time in green, wide open spaces, like Greenwich and Hampstead. I then found it necessary to leave London altogether and move back to my home town. I could not work a normal job for some years after this and survived mostly off my savings and then taking low-key jobs with low stress, like language tutoring and online customer support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Going through this experience was like dying and being reborn. The person that came back from that universal state was not the same that existed before. It took years to come to terms with that and rebuild some of my relationships, especially with family, whilst some friendships never recovered from the changes I went through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The work is never done. It&amp;#39;s not like the breakthrough happened and now I&amp;#39;m set for life. I struggle with integration, just like everybody else. My Kundalini Shakti mostly works in the background, just above the threshold of consciousness. If I don&amp;#39;t pay attention, I barely notice it, but as soon as I quieten my mind, not even to meditate, but just to sit down and think, read or whatever other quiet, self-reflective activity I choose to do, it becomes immediately apparent and the sensations arising from its activity are much stronger.

I started out as an atheist, pretty much, though I did believe in the spiritual dimension of life, a denial of which bothered me about the New Atheists who were in vogue at the time.

By letting go of at least one part of my atheism, through unknowing worship of Mesopotamian deities, I received divine help and my Granthis could be overcome or dissolved. I did not realise, that me researching them, spending time in the presence of their consecrated artefacts, trying to decipher the meaning of various symbolic objects and reliefs and meditating on their significance was a form of unknowing worship. This is what connected me to the deities in question and it provided a gradual out from my atheism. \n\nAt first, influenced by writings of people like Zecharia Sitchin, I thought that the Anunna might be aliens, or some sort of transdimensional beings and given the evidence of their influence on human civilisation ( as far as we can tell, they basically gave it to us), I found it plausible, that they might be real, along with Hindu deities. \n\nSo, Mesopotamian deities were a surreptitious route by which I could accept the reality of divine beings in general. Only much later did I truly realise, that many old Testament stories are actually based on Sumerian antecedents and that these deities make an appearance in the Bible. For instance, the serpent on the tree in the Garden of Eden story most likely comes from Inanna and The Huluppu tree. The garden of Edin, Adamu, the flood, Noah's Ark, the creation myth, these are all Mesopotamian in origin, which is not surprising, given Abraham and his retinue was from the city of Ur in Mesopotamia. \n\nThe Veneration of the Holy Mother, particularly in her Queen of Heaven aspect, comes from Inanna-Ishtar and later Astarte's worship. The Cosmic Shekinah is a good book to explore that, if you're interested in the topic. \n\nThe Bible itself has two main deities in it, or rather groups of deities. The original deity, the only one that appears in Genesis for instance is Elohim. This is based on the Canaanite pantheon of El, the Sky God (a direct equivalent of An/Anu in Mesopotamia) and his 70 children, who were collectively known as the Elohim. The Sumerian equivalent were An's 7 children, the Anunna (Inanna, Enki and Utu among them), who sat on a sort of divine council, weaving the fate of mortals. In the Bible, the divine council also makes an appearance, for instance in the book of Job.\n\nI digress, but you see my point, this is really very complex. I still don't know what to think about Yahweh, who often appears as a sort of interloper who came in later, I suspect, that as with Osiris in Egypt, it was a power play by the Yahwist priesthood to marginalise their Elohist rivals and the Bible was heavily altered as a result to try and remove references to other deities or demonise them in some cases. \n\nIn any case, I have come to accept, that there is much wisdom in Abrahamic religions, but it is hidden and buried deep, often covered in allegory.
